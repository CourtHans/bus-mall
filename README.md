201 Week 3 bus-mall project

My week 3 project to test out a variety of products with a user group. Each user will be presented a various selection of 3 different products. The user will then click on their preferred object, and the set will refresh (not repeating any of the 3 images shown immediately previous). After the user has clicked 25 times, the clicking will stop and results will be calculated. A chart will show how many times each product was shown, and how many times the user clicked on it, with a second chart displaying percentage of clicked/shown.

## Reflections and Comments
Would love to put a nice border around the charts, but then it shows upon initial page load...how to hide this and then display?
What is the optimal size to display a chart?
