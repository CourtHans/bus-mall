201 Week 3 bus-mall project

My week 3 project to test out a variety of products with a user group. Each user will be presented a various selection of 3 different products. The user will then click on their preferred object, and the set will refresh. After the user has clicked 25 times, the clicking will stop and results will tally in a results section. The tally will show how many times each product was shown, and how many times the user clicked on it.
