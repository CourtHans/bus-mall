201 Week 3 bus-mall project

My week 3 project to test out a variety of products with a user group. Each user will be presented a various selection of 3 different products. The user will then click on their preferred object, and the set will refresh (not repeating any of the 3 images shown immediately previous). After the user has clicked 25 times, the clicking will stop and results will tally in a results section. The tally will show how many times each product was shown, and how many times the user clicked on it. A chart will render to visually convey the data.
